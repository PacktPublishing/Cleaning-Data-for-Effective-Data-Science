## About the Book

It is something of a truism in data science, data analysis, or machine learning
that most of the effort needed to achieve your actual purpose lies in cleaning
your data. Written in David’s signature friendly and humorous style, this book
discusses in detail the essential steps performed in every production data
science or data analysis pipeline and prepares you for data visualization and
modeling results.

The book dives into the practical application of tools and techniques needed
for data ingestion, anomaly detection, value imputation, and feature
engineering. It also offers long-form exercises at the end of each chapter to
practice the skills acquired.

You will begin by looking at data ingestion of data formats such as JSON, CSV,
SQL RDBMSes, HDF5, NoSQL databases, files in image formats, and binary
serialized data structures. Further, the book provides numerous example data
sets and data files, which are available for download and independent
exploration.

Moving on from formats, you will impute missing values, detect unreliable data
and statistical anomalies, and generate synthetic features that are necessary
for successful data analysis and visualization goals.

By the end of this book, you will have acquired a firm understanding of the
data cleaning process necessary to perform real-world data science and machine
learning tasks.
