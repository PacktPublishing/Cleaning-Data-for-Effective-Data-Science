    "It is something of a truism in data science, data analysis, or machine learning that most of the effort needed to achieve your actual purpose lies in cleaning your data.  The subtitle of this work alludes to a commonly assigned percentage.  A keynote speaker I listened to at a data science conference a few years ago made a joke—perhaps one already widely repeated by the time he told it—about talking with a colleague of his.  The colleague complained of data cleaning taking up half of her time, in response to which the speaker expressed astonishment that it could be so little as 50%."

Even data sets that have been published, carefully studied, and that are widely distributed as canonical examples for statistics textbooks or software libraries, generally have a moderate number of data integrity problems.  Even after our best pre-processing, a more attainable goal should be to make our data *less dirty*; making it *clean* remains unduly utopian in aspiration."

Data can be dirty (up to a point) but still be enormously useful.  Data can be (relatively) clean but have little purpose, or at least not be fit for purpose.  Concerns about the choice of measurements to collect, or about possible selection bias, or other methodological or scientific questions are mostly outside the scope of this book.  However, a fair number of techniques I present can *aid* in evaluating the utility of data, but there is often no mechanical method of remedying systemic issues.  For example, statistics and other analyses may reveal—or at least strongly suggest—the unreliability of a certain data field.  But the techniques in this book cannot generally automatically fix that unreliable data or collect better data."

Not every problem neatly divides into these families, or at least it is not always evident which side something falls on without knowing the root cause.  But in a general way we can think of structural problems in the formatting of data versus content problems in the actual values recorded.  On the structural branch a format used to encode a data set might simply \"put values in the wrong place\" in one way or another.  On the content side, the data format itself is correct, but implausible or wrong values have snuck in via flawed instruments, transcription errors, numeric overflows, or through other pitfalls of the recording process."

Sometimes these transformations are between data formats or in-memory representations. At other times we impute, massage, sample, aggregate, or collate data.  Every time some transformation is made on data, we bring in certain assumptions or goals of our own; these may well be—and ideally *should* be—well motivated by task purpose or numeric and statistical analysis.

Most VCSs allow a concept of a *branch* where different versions of files can be maintained in parallel.  If available, use of this capability is often desirable.

It is often possible for them to calculate a \"minimal change set\" to describe a transformation rather than simply storing an entirely new near-copy for each version.  Whether or not your VCS does this with the formats you work with, data integrity and data provenance should be a more prominent concern than the potential need to allocate more disk space.  Of late, Git is the most popular VCS; but the advice here can equally be followed using Apache Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, IBM Rational ClearCase, or any other modern VCS. Indeed, an older system like Concurrent Versions System (CVS) suffices for this purpose."
